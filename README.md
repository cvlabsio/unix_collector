# unix_collector

A shell script for basic forensic collection of various artefacts from UNIX systems. ```unix_collector``` is a script that runs on various Unix systems and attempts to collect artefacts which could be analysed in attempt to identify potential system compromise. ```unix_collector``` is written as a single shell script so it can be easily uploaded and run (as opposed to un-tarred, compiled and installed). It can run either as a normal user or as root. It does a better job when running as root because it can read more files of course.

# Available platforms

* Sun Solaris
* Linux
* IBM AIX
* HPUX
* MacOS
* Debian
* Ubuntu
* CentOS
* Red Hat
* Android
* Probably others as well.

# Script Activities

* Enumerate basic host information such as kernel version, processes, hostname and save details in output directory.
* Enumerate files written to the disk and create basic timeline using 'stat' command.
* Enumerate network information and save details in output directory.
* Enumerate patch and installed software information and save details in output directory.
* Enumerate process list and other process information and save details in output directory.
* Enumerate application lists, plist/apk for iOS/Android save them in output directory. 
* Hash files in various folders such as /home/ /opt/ /usr/ and save details in output directory.
* Hash files which are marked as SGID or SUID and save details in output directory.
* Copy various files such as cron job, plist or other files into output directory.
* Copy SUID/SGID binaries into output directory.
* Copy home directories into output directory.
* Copy specific /proc/ files into output directory.
* Copy system logs (i.e /var/log or /var/adm/) into output directory.
* Copy /dev/shm into output directory.
* TAR entire output directory and use hostname as file name with current date.
* Where copy or hashing operation happens, files over 500MB will be skipped. This default behaviour can be modified inside the script by changing RSYNC_MAX_FILESIZE, TAR_MAX_FILESIZE and HASH_MAX_FILESIZE global variables.

# Requirements

* Enough space on the disk so logs and other files can be copied into single location (alternatively run from mounted disk or network partition).
* sh

# Examples 

Execute ```unix_collector``` without specifying any operating system version (script will guess OS type):

```chmod +x ./unix_collector.sh && ./unix_collector.sh```

Execute ```unix_collector``` on AIX while specifying platform:

```chmod +x ./unix_collector.sh && ./unix_collector.sh --platform=aix```

Execute ```unix_collector``` on MacOS while specifying platform:

```chmod +x ./unix_collector.sh && ./unix_collector.sh --platform=mac```
